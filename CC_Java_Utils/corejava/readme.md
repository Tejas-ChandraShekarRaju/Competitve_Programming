    **About Static on classes**
    You cannot use the static keyword with a class unless it is an inner class. A static inner class is a nested class which is a static member of the outer class. It can be accessed without instantiating the outer class, using other static members. Just like static members, a static nested class does not have access to the instance variables and methods of the outer class.

2. ### Method overriding is a part of run time polymorphism.

3. ### Can we use try without a catch block?
     yes we can use it with a finally block.
